### Career Progression 
- **2025-Present:** Cactus Compute (YC S25) - Founder & CTO
- **2024-25:** Deep Render - AI Research Engineer (Tiny AI models for realtime video compression)
- **2021-24:** Wisdm - ML Software Engineer (Perception AI for Maxar Defence satelite imagery)
- **2019-21:** Open-source activities during MSc (NanoDl, SuperLazyLLM, CUDARepo, etc.)
- **2018-19:** Google Africa Developer Scholarship Programme with Andela (pre-MSc)
- **2014-18:** Uni coursework in computing, electronics, data structures, algorithms, maths, physics.

### Fun Highlights 
- My research with previous employers were all proprietary, but you'd like [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.30.551149v1.full.pdf) and [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henry_Ndubuaku/publication/373111729_Improving_Creativity_In_Humour_Generation_With_Conditional_Stochastic_Latent-Sampling_Encoders/links/64da4aa4ad846e2882925089/Improving-Creativity-In-Humour-Generation-With-Conditional-Stochastic-Latent-Sampling-Encoders.pdf).
- I wrote this handbook and executable code for maths, ML, and computing, ideal for diving into the depth of ML foundations [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ftH86vZMbspy1QvW4cHlTTv3GOMmdZ_H?usp=sharing).
- Kevin Murphy (DeepMind Principal), Daniel Holtz (Mid Journey Founder), Steve Messina (IBM CTO) followed back on X after NanoDL.
- After CUDARepo, Nvidia reached out, I did 6 technical rounds, got a verbal offer, back-and-forth over YOE/pay, then I got YC.
- Did MSc at QMUL, just to work with Prof Matt Purver (Ex-Stanford Researcher on CALO), did my project/thesis with his team.
- Did BEng under Prof Onyema Uzoamaka (Rumoured first Nigerian CS grad from MIT), he taught computing architecture off-head!
- I contribute to the JAX ecosystem, and am a Google Developer Expert in AI and JAX.
- Recieved the British Talent Immigration within 24hrs of application (no prority appeal or anything).

### Life Principles
- When the talented fail to work hard, the hardworking beat the talented.
- Everything should be an adventure, not a race, everyone gets their moment someday.
- Make the best of your situation, complaining and pointing fingers do nothing. 
- It often takes 120% effort, focus and passion, failure often results from giving less. 

### Future PhD Interests 
- Realtime EEG-to-Instruction AI for Brain-Machine Interfaces (MS patients could prompt agents to execute tasks). 
- RL Algorithm for Distilling a User's Cognitive Signatures into a Model (imagine your proxy, need to define "signatures"). 
- Realtime Visual-Action World Models for drones, aerial robots, phones, tiny robots etc. 
- Decentralised Compute Grid from Tiny Edge devices like phones, drones, robots (world models need more compute).
